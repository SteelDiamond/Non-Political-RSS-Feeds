# Do not Request list

This is a list of RSS feeds I have determined to be too political. I'll be nice and still provide you with links to some their RSS feeds if you really want them, and if they were on the list before, with the criteria they had before they were banned.

If you think I have made a mistake, please let me know, RSS feeds can sometimes be hard to find, so it's possible I missed something.

## Please do not request. . .
### The New York Times
**Link**: https://www.nytimes.com/rss

**Date Banned**: November 22, 2024

Reason: Paywalled. I can't review them, and the few RSS feeds I tried were a mix of real news and unnecessary politics. I gave up after this.

### Time Magazine

**Link**: https://time.com/archive/6903659/rss-feeds-for-time-online/

**Date Banned**: November 22, 2024

Reason: Non-Political Feeds are largely or completely political, and even things like history on their site includes current US politics. I gave up after this.

## Permanently Banned 

### Simply Recipes

**Date Banned**: November 20, 2024

**Link**: https://feeds-api.dotdashmeredith.com/v1/rss/standard/3b53043e-ca31-4817-b47f-47f69efbb29c

Reason: They have politics, on a *recipe* site. Not just any website, a website that bills it self as *simply* recipes. This is false advertising. This ban will likely never be lifted.
