# Do not Request list

This is a list of RSS feeds I have determined to be too political. I'll be nice and still provide you with links to some their RSS feeds if you really want them, and if they were on the list before, with the criteria they had before they were banned. 

If you think I have made a mistake, please let me know, RSS feeds can sometimes be hard to find, so it's possible I missed something.

## Please do not request. . .

+ ✅ Updates Regularly
+ ✅ Free
+ ✅ Annoying feature free: Does not have autoplaying videos, videos that follow you, or other annoying features.
+ ❌ Not time tested
+ ❌ Articles are aggressive with trying to get you to view political content.
+ ☠️ RSS Feeds Very hard to find or requires a 3rd party
+ ☠️ RSS Feed has no options
+ ☠️ There is an RSS feed, but non-political feeds are non-existent

I really wanted to give AP News a chance as I really wanted to balance the list, but in the end, I already had to use a 3rd party to generate feeds for non-political sections, and after a few days of using feeds for their subesections I would have to wade through too many political articles to get to anything worth reading.

Many of the articles were just looking for an excuse to be political, such as "Athletes speak their fears: Climate change threatens their spot and their health". Yeah, other sources are smart enough to know this doesn't belong in a lifestyle section.

Even the sub-section pets where I don't have a 3rd party feed, they are *still* talking about politics! The only section I couldn't find politics in was Food & Recipes. Even Oddities, which you would think would be silly things like Pumpkin Boats had a article about a politician. 

And the articles, were not much better. On article that I also found on another source about a "$344 for a coffee", I'm greeted to a bar that follows me everywhere at the top of the screen that contains politics, and the middle of the article contains political quiz! Sometimes it recommends me politics on other non-political articles as well, not always.

But RSS feeds is the primary reason my tier list exists. Since their main feed is filled with trash, and not even a third party RSS feed can save them, am moving them to the Do Not Request list.

My final opinion: I would not recommend the AP to anyone. Simply put, AP News is unprofessional with its RSS feeds, and in my opinion, unprofessional for a company of it's size. It's a shame because they don't have any of the other annoying features many other sources have. But I rather live with a small annoyance then have my feed gummed up with political trash.

### The New York Times

**Link**: https://www.nytimes.com/rss

**Date Added**: November 22, 2024

Reason: Paywalled. I can't review them, and the few RSS feeds I tried were a mix of real news and unnecessary politics. I gave up after this.

### Time Magazine

**Link**: https://time.com/archive/6903659/rss-feeds-for-time-online/

**Date Added**: November 22, 2024

Reason: Non-Political Feeds are largely or completely political, and even things like history on their site includes current US politics. I gave up after this.

## Permanently Banned 

These are feeds are very unlikely to be added to my list. Again, I will still be fair and offer a link to them if you really want them.

### Simply Recipes

**Date Banned**: November 20, 2024

**Link**: https://feeds-api.dotdashmeredith.com/v1/rss/standard/3b53043e-ca31-4817-b47f-47f69efbb29c

Reason: They have politics, on a *recipe* site. Not just any website, a website that bills it self as *simply* recipes. This is false advertising. This ban will likely never be lifted.
