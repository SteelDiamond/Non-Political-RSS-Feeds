# SteelDiamond's Tier List for Non-Political RSS Newsfeeds

Politics are for failures. Let's get back to talking about \*real\* things.

This list is a work in progress, at a later date, I want to make it easier to read. For now, this will do.

Pull requests are not accepted on this repository.

## Boring Stuff

Don't like my list? [Here's a list of people who felt differently](https://github.com/SteelDiamond/Non-Political-RSS-Feeds/forks), I hope one of them suits your needs.

<details>
    <summary>Criteria</summary>  

##### 1. Time - How long it has been tested.

✅ Time Tested

➖ Time Tested, but may have shown unnecessary content when last checked.

❌ Not time tested

##### 2. RSS Discoverability - How easy it is to find the RSS feed of your choice

✅ RSS Feeds Easy to find

➖ RSS feeds are somewhat easy to find

❌ RSS Feeds Hard to find

☠️ RSS Feeds Very hard to find or requires a 3rd party

##### 3. Filtering - How much can you fine tune what you are looking for.

This should be a standard feature since just about every CMS/Blog software supports the automatic generation of RSS feeds, and in the case of Wordpress, you can even get it down to the tag level. There should be no reason why I cannot fine tune what I want.

Furthermore I should not have to use a third party service to do this. I am sure Wordpress Plugins exist. There should be no reason why I cannot append something like **?include=Food&exclude=SomePoliticalTag** to the end of a URL.

✅ RSS feed offers many filtering options

➖ RSS feed offers few options

❌ RSS Feed does not offer many options

☠️ RSS Feed has no options

☠️ RSS Feed does not work

##### 4. Non-Political remain non-political - How often feeds include unwanted politics. 

For example Lifestyle shouldn't have articles rambling on about a politician, climate change, or anything like that those either belong under politics, or a climate section. Food And Drink shouldn't be rambling on about CO2 emissions. Science/Tech shouldn't be going on about who was picked what in a government's cabinet. And so on. 

✅ Non-Political feeds are largely or completely free from Politics

➖ Non-Political feeds are mostly free Politics

❌ Non-Political feeds sometimes mix in Politics

❌ Non-Political feeds are non-existent, but politics can still be mostly avoided

☠️ There is an RSS feed, but non-political feeds are non-existent

##### 5. Update Frequency - How often is new news pushed out

✅ Updates Regularly

➖ Updates Occasionally

❌ Updates less often

☠️ Updates Rarely

##### 6. Suggestions - When reading an article, how aggressive is the source with trying to get you to view their political content

✅ Articles don't Recommend political content on you

➖ Articles may recommend political content on you, but it's minor. (Trending Stories that don't scroll with you, it's a the bottom of the page where you can ignore it, etc)

❌ Articles are aggressive with trying to get you to view political content.

☠️ Articles are very aggressive trying to get you to view political content.

##### 7. Cost - Free is better, but nothing wrong with paying for quality content

✅ Free

✅ Paid, but have the option to pay only for non-political news

➖ Mostly Free, some paywalls

❌ Mostly Not free

☠️ Paid, and can't avoid funding political news

##### 8. User Interface - Does the site offer a good experience, or is annoying, abusive, or political?

✅ Annoying feature free: Does not have autoplaying videos, videos that follow you, or other annoying features.

➖ Has an autoplaying video, or the video follows you, but it's relevant to the article.
❌ Has a video, regardless of auto-playing or following you contains politics you didn't ask for, or when it's done, jumps to politics.

❌ Other annoying features

☠️ Has a video, auto-plays and follows you, and it's political in nature.

<summary>My Process</summary>

I do not care how the source leans politically. I'm more concerned with how the present news in sections that should not contain politics at all. 

I am always interested in trying to find sources from all sides that I can so I can keep this list more balanced, that is not always easy as some sources simply have poor filtering, unnecessary politics, an impossible to find RSS feed, or no RSS feed at all.

Just because I list something here, does not mean I endorse it. I don't know how I can make that any clearer.

These are the guidelines I try my best to follow when looking for non-political news. In the end, I make a judgment call based on how I feel about the source. You are free to disagree.

* Does the source have an RSS feed that contains a section that would normally include non-political news? If not, it doesn't go on this list.

  * I try to check to see if they have feeds such as "Food And Drink", "Odd News", "Lifestyle", "Crime", "Science / Technology", and things like that.

* How easy is it to find the RSS feed?

* How finely can you filter for what you want?

* Is the feed free from unwanted politics?

  * If it isn't. Should it be?. If it should and it contains politics it's an automatic ban. (IE. a recipe site should not have politics)
  
  * If it isn't an out-right ban, how bad is it? The more political news, the worse the score.

* When reading an article on their site, how aggressive are they with trying to get you to view their political content?
    
  * If it's at the bottom of the page and easily ignored, a very minor infraction. 
    
  * If it's in the middle article in "You might also be interested in" kind of box, regular infraction.
  
  * If it's on the side, how fast it's out of view results in a better score.
    
  * If it's an auto playing video that isn't relevant to the article, major infarction. Double if it follows you.
  
* Do they have an abusive user interface such as auto playing videos, modal subscribe by e-mail dialogs, or other such things?

In the end, things like **Vinyl Record from 1966 Wedding found**, **Killer Clown in Florida is released**, **McDonald's decommissions Expresso machines due to safety concerns**, and **Egyptians drank cocktails of psychedelic drugs in ancient mugs, research reveals** is real news that is fun to talk about.

News like **Some Politician buys Canned Soup**, **Some bill no one cares about was passed**, **Mustard is a secret Turtle Clan Dogwhistle, and why they're evil!**, **Some War that doesn't impact you in anyway, and why you must move zig and care for great justice!**, and **Some guy you never heard of was chosen to be something in some government** are not. That's boring lame political trash.

## The List
### A-Tier

To reach the A-Tier, the feed must be completely free from politics, with very few infractions against you, and it must be time tested by me.

#### UPI - Odd News
**Rank:** A++

**Link**: https://rss.upi.com/news/odd_news_rss

**Date added**: September 2018?

**Last Checked**: Daily

+ ✅ Time Tested.
+ ✅ Easy to find RSS Feed
+ ✅ RSS feed offers many filtering options
+ ✅ Non-Political feeds are completely free from Politics
+ ✅ Articles do not recommend political content to you
+ ✅ Free
+ ✅ Does not have auto-playing videos or other annoying features.
+ ➖ Updates Occasionally

UPI's Odd News is the undisputed champ. Odd news is just odd news. Even their other sections outside of Odd News don't force politics on you. I have been an avid reader since 2018.

### B-Tier

This is for feeds that are either Not time tested, or are time tested, but still have some flaws such as recommending political news when it is not desired.

#### CTVNews
**Rank:** B+

**Link:** https://www.ctvnews.ca/more/rss-feeds-for-ctv-news

**Date added:** November 21 2024

**Lasted tested on**: November 21 2024

+ ✅ Easy to find RSS Feed
+ ✅ RSS feed offers many filtering options
+ ✅ Non-Political feeds are largely or completely free from Politics
+ ✅ Updates Regularly
+ ✅ Free
+ ➖ Articles may recommend political content on you, but it's minor.
+ ➖ Has an autoplaying video, or the video follows you, but it's relevant to the article.
+ ❌ Not time tested

There is an annoying red bar at the top of the page which often has news about politics. Easily disabled via CSS.

Other than that, I have no comments at this time. Source seems fairly good.

#### CBS (Local Sites)
**Rank:** B

**Link:** https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/

**Date added:** November 21 2024

**Lasted tested on**: November 21 2024

+ ✅ RSS feed offers many filtering options
+ ✅ Non-Political feeds are largely or completely free from Politics
+ ✅ Updates Regularly
+ ✅ Articles don't Recommend political content on you
+ ✅ Free
+ ➖ RSS feeds are somewhat easy to find
+ ➖ (Sometimes) Has an autoplaying video, or the video follows you, but it's relevant to the article.
+ ❌ Not time tested

CBS has many local sites, I tested Chicago with this one.

The auto playing video does not always happen. In some articles, it's in the middle of the page, doesn't start automatically, and thus does not follow you. 

It would also be nice if they had a list of RSS feeds, but they are still discoverable.

#### Rochester First
**Rank:** B

**Link:** https://www.rochesterfirst.com/

**Date added:** November 21 2024

**Lasted tested on**: November 21 2024

+ ✅ RSS feed offers many filtering options
+ ✅ Non-Political feeds are largely or completely free from Politics
+ ✅ Updates Regularly
+ ✅ Free
+ ✅ Annoying feature free
+ ➖ Articles may recommend political content on you, but it's minor.
+ ➖ RSS Feeds were somewhat easy to find
+ ❌ Not time tested

It's local to Rochester, but they have news that is not just for their area, and it's largely not political. Plus it is annoying feature free, so that is always nice.

If the feeds were a bit more easier to find, I'd bump this to a B+.

#### Fox News
**Rank:** B-

**Link:** https://www.foxnews.com/

**Date added:** November 21 2024

**Lasted tested on**: November 21 2024

+ ✅ Non-Political feeds are largely or completely free from Politics
+ ✅ Updates Regularly
+ ✅ Free
+ ✅ Articles don't recommend political content on you
+ ✅ Comment Section (not factored into score)
+ ➖ RSS Feeds were somewhat easy to find
+ ➖ RSS Feed offers few options
+ ➖ Has an autoplaying video, or the video follows you, but it's relevant to the article.
+ ❌ Not time tested

I could only find one local one, and it was more political than the actual main site. Strange since those usually are a little less political. Maybe I found the wrong local one.

I tested Life Style, and Science & Technology.

The only major drawbacks of Fox News was that they did not offer filtering options. I could get lifestyle for instance, but I could not limit it to Food & Drink. Thankfully most sections don't push political articles, or anything political is very minor. For that reason I'm ranking it a B- rather than a B or B+.

Sometimes the autoplaying video doesn't actually play, but it still follows you.

Despite all the bad rap it gets for being politicaL, I was not pushed anything political. I was not once in any of articles I viewed recommended a political article to read next, and the videos were all on relevant. Maybe I got lucky.


#### NBC (Local Sites)
**Rank:** B-

**Link:** https://www.nbcnewyork.com/

**Date added:** November 21 2024

**Lasted tested on**: November 21 2024

+ ✅ RSS feed offers many filtering options
+ ✅ Non-Political feeds are largely or completely free from Politics
+ ✅ Updates Regularly
+ ✅ Free 
+ ➖ RSS feeds are somewhat easy to find
+ ➖ Articles may recommend political content on you, but it's minor.
+ ➖ Has an autoplaying video, or the video follows you, but it's relevant to the article.
+ ❌ Not time tested 

NBC has a number of news sites based in different cities that more or less have many of the same stories. I tested New York which contains news for New York, as well as other interesting non-political news shared by all the local sites.

My biggest complaint is that it is a bit more aggressive with pushing politics to you, but it wasn't aggressive enough to convince me to rank it down more.

It would also be nice if they had a list of RSS feeds, but they are still discoverable.

#### NPR
**Rank:** B-

**Link:** https://abcnews.go.com/Site/page/rss-feeds-3520115

**Date added:** November 21 2024

**Lasted tested on**: November 21 2024

+ ✅ RSS feed offers many filtering options
+ ✅ Non-Political feeds are largely or completely free from Politics
+ ✅ Updates Regularly
+ ✅ Free
+ ➖ Articles may recommend political content on you, but it's minor.
+ ➖ RSS Feeds were somewhat easy to find
+ ❌ Articles can be read to you, but sometimes when it's done it queues up a political article next.
+ ❌ Not time tested

NPR has some of the best filtering I've seen for RSS feeds. I would have much preferred a list though, so I could easily select the ones I wanted. This is minor.

Because of their filtering, I was able to completely ignore political news.

I do like that I can have the articles read to me, but this where the negative point comes in, when it's done, it immediately jumped to a political story.

#### New York Post
**Rank:** B-

**Link:** https://nypost.com/rssfeeds/

**Date added:** November 21 2024

**Lasted tested on**: November 21 2024

+ ✅ RSS Feeds Easy to find
+ ✅ Non-Political feeds are largely or completely free from Politics
+ ✅ Updates Regularly
+ ✅ Free
+ ✅ Comment Section (Was not factored in)
+ ➖ Articles may recommend political content on you, but it's minor.
+ ➖ Has an autoplaying video, or the video follows you, but it's relevant to the article.
+ ❌ RSS Feed does not offer many options (read below)
+ ❌ Not time tested

The RSS feeds it lists on their site are not all the feeds they have. Sub-Sections also do, so it is a bit misleading.

Also the trending news follows you, or one of the other side panels, which is just annoying as it often contains political trash. This isn't super aggressive, but it's teetering very close the being ranked a C for that reason.

Also, there is a comment section, which I always like. This is not factored into the score.

#### ABC News
**Rank:** B--

**Link:** https://abcnews.go.com/Site/page/rss-feeds-3520115

**Date added:** November 21 2024

**Lasted tested on**: November 21 2024

+ ✅ Easy to find RSS Feed
+ ✅ Non-Political feeds are largely or completely free from Politics, albeit a bit devoid of content
+ ✅ Updates Regularly
+ ✅ Free
+ ➖ Articles may recommend political content on you, but it's minor.
+ ➖ Has an autoplaying video, or the video follows you, but it's relevant to the article.
+ ❌ RSS Feeds do not offer many options.
+ ❌ Not time tested

My biggest complaint is that it needs more filtering options. For example, there are news stories under **U.S. Headlines** that have non-political stories in them, and unless it shows up in the Popular Reads section that I'd like to block out, I'd never see them. They already have a feed named **Politics Headlines**, so why not just stick those stories there and keep the rest politics free?

If this were to change, I could write a CSS Rule and hide Popular Reads and avoid politics all together, and I would easily move them to a B+.

#### The Globe and Mail
**Rank:** B--

**Link:** https://globeandmail.my.site.com/helpcentre/s/article/New-RSS-feed-URL-structure-introduced

**Date added:** November 21 2024

**Lasted tested on**: November 21 2024

+ ✅ RSS Feeds Easy to find
+ ✅ RSS feed offers many filtering options
+ ✅ Updates Regularly
+ ✅ Articles don't Recommend political content on you
+ ➖ Non-Political feeds are mostly free politics
+ ➖ Mostly Free, but no option to pay for non-political content only
+ ➖ Has an autoplaying video, or the video follows you, but it's relevant to the article.
+ ❌ Not time tested

I'm ranking this higher simply because of the myriad of choices you have when filtering news. They have the best I have ever seen, and even easier to discover than all the other sources on this list.

Only some of their articles are free. To get the non-free ones you have to pay, but paying also gives money to political content.

The only other major downside is while testing it I did get some political news while testing Lifestyle. If this keeps up, I may have to bump this down to a C-Tier.

#### Toronto Star 
**Rank:** B--

**Link:** https://www.thestar.com/site/static-pages/rss-feeds.html

**Date added:** November 21 2024

**Lasted tested on**: November 21 2024

+ ✅ RSS Feeds Easy to find
+ ✅ RSS feed offers many filtering options
+ ✅ Non-Political feeds are largely or completely free from Politics
+ ✅ Articles don't Recommend political content on you
+ ✅ Updates Regularly
+ ❌ Other annoying features (Modal E-mail Dialog popup)
+ ❌ Not time tested
+ ☠️ Have to pay and it funds political news

You know what's annoying? Dialog that get in your way when you are trying to read an article demanding you give it your e-mail. Why would I gave you my e-mail, when your content isn't even free? Why? So you can spam me articles I can't read?

There is no free option, you can few a limited number of articles before you have to pay. The pay option also funds political news. 

I can't fault them too much though, they were able to keep politics out of non-political sections when I checked.

### C-Tier

C-Tier is for sources that have problems, such as mixing a minor amount of politics into sections that should be free from politics, or other annoyances that could easily be fixed (Bad RSS options, not clear how to get their RSS Feed, abusive interface practices, etc). They may be OK.

#### BBC News
**Rank:** C+

**Link:** https://www.bbc.com/news/10628494

**Date added:** November 21 2024

**Lasted tested on**: November 21 2024

+ ✅ RSS Feeds Easy to find
+ ✅ Updates Regularly
+ ✅ Articles don't Recommend political content on you
+ ✅ Free
+ ✅ Annoying feature free
+ ➖  RSS feed offers few options
+ ❌ Non-Political feeds sometimes mix in Politics (Feed dependant)
+ ❌ Not time tested

Their filtering options aren't the best. Some sub-categories would be nice to have as RSS feeds. They're one of the better options, I just wish there was less political news offered in Non-Political feeds.

#### Reuters
**Rank:** C+

**Link:** https://www.reutersagency.com/en/reutersbest/reuters-best-rss-feeds/

**Date added:** November 21 2024

**Lasted tested on**: November 21 2024

+ ✅ RSS Feeds Easy to find
+ ✅ RSS Feed offers many filtering options
+ ✅ Non-Political feeds are largely or completely free from Politics
+ ✅ Updates Regularly
+ ✅ Articles don't recommend political content on you
+ ✅ Free
+ ✅ Annoying feature free
+ ❌ Not time tested
+ ☠ RSS Feed does not work

I'm only ranking Reuters a C+ because their RSS feeds are broken, and they have been for years according to posts on Stackoverflow and Reddit. I'm sure they must know this. This is very unprofessional.

However, if you do get them to work, I tested Human Interest, and the experience was one of the best ones I have had.

If they ever fix their RSS feeds, or someone can tell me what wrong, I will reconsider their ranking. As it is, I did not try it out very long because of the broken RSS feed, so who knows, maybe they're actually worse rather than better.

#### Sky News
**Rank:** C

**Link:** https://news.sky.com/info/rss

**Date added:** November 21 2024

**Lasted tested on**: November 21 2024

+ ✅ RSS Feeds Easy to find
+ ✅ Updates Regularly
+ ✅ (Sometimes?) Articles don't Recommend political content on you
+ ✅ Free
+ ✅ Annoying feature free: Does not have autoplaying videos, videos that follow you, or other annoying features.
+ ➖ RSS feed offers few option
+ ❌ Non-Political feeds sometimes mix in Politics
+ ❌ Not time tested

The articles themselves don't appear to offer your political news, but I am certain I saw it at least once. I'll give it a pass since I haven't seen it a second time.

Other than that, they have the same problem as ABC news, only worse.

Much like ABC there are stories there are stories that are non-political, but they're in a section that mixes regular news with political news.

Unlike ABC news, they take it a step further, and their non-political RSS feeds include politics in them.

If they could fix these oversights, they'd easily be in the B tier.

#### CNN
**Rank:** C--

**Link:** https://support.itesmedia.tv/available-rss-feeds-from-cnn

**Date added:** November 21 2024

**Lasted tested on**: November 21 2024

+ ✅ Non-Political feeds are largely or completely free from Politics
+ ✅ Articles don't Recommend political content on you
+ ✅ Free
+ ❌ Not time tested
+ ❌ RSS Feed does not offer many options
+ ❌ Updates less often (on some feds)
+ ❌ Other annoying features (no text version of the article)
+ ☠️ RSS Feeds Very hard to find or requires a 3rd party

Not a clue how you are supposed to find their RSS feeds, and it's a shame since they seem to have some okay articles without politics. It does not appear that every section has a feed either.

I'll reconsider ranking this if the RSS situation improves, or if someone can show me how you go about getting their RSS information.

#### USA Today 
**Rank:** C--

**Link:** Unknown (Allegedly Offered)

**Date added:** November 21 2024

**Lasted tested on**: November 21 2024

+ ✅ Free
+ ❌ Not time tested
+ ☠️ RSS Feeds Very hard to find or requires a 3rd party
+ ☠️ Articles are very aggressive trying to get you to view political content.
+ ☠️ Has a video, auto-plays and follows you, and it's political in nature.

I cannot fully rate this, but sections on their site don't appear to have politics mixed in with non-political news.

They allegedly have RSS feeds for each section, but I cannot find it anywhere on their site. Their non-political sections seem to largely be politics free, which if I could find an RSS feed, would put this higher on the list.

My biggest complaint is that the articles contain autoplaying videos that not only follow you around, they also contain politics that are not related to the article. Otherwise the appear to be largely non-political.

If it turns out there are no RSS feeds, I'll simply remove USA Today from the list since this is an RSS feed.

### D-Tier

This tier is for sources that have major problems. They may be more aggressive with trying to get you to view political content, or are not professional with their RSS feeds. Some of the sources  listed here are to give the list some balance and to highlight just how bad some sources can be, when they really don't have to be, and may even be fixable with a 3rd party option, which shouldn't be required.

#### Yahoo News
**Rank:** D+

**Link:** None given, because I can't find that has any RSS Feeds.

**Date added:** November 21 2024

**Lasted tested on**: November 21 2024

+ ✅ Annoying feature free: Does not have autoplaying videos, videos that follow you, or other annoying features.
+ ✅ Updates Regularly (I'm assuming)
+ ✅ Free
+ ❌ Not time tested
+ ❌ RSS Feed does not offer many options (Or it appears not to)
+ ❌ Non-Political feeds sometimes mix in Politics
+ ❌ Articles are aggressive with trying to get you to view political content.
+ ☠️ RSS Feeds Very hard to find or requires a 3rd party

Yahoo News does offer RSS feeds, but I cannot for the life of me figure how you access them. I ended up finding a Reddit post that listed a few of them, but even then, some did not work.

The feeds I did find do not seem to have any filtering options. They force political articles you didn't ask for.

The articles really try to get you to read unrelated political news too.

#### Axios (Local Sites)
**Rank:** D+

**Link:** https://api.axios.com/feed/

**Date added:** November 21 2024

**Lasted tested on**: November 21 2024

+ ✅ Updates Regularly
+ ✅ Articles don't Recommend political content on you
+ ✅ Free
+ ✅ Annoying feature free
+ ❌ Not time tested
+ ☠️ RSS Feeds Very hard to find or requires a 3rd party
+ ☠️ RSS Feed has no options
+ ☠️ There is an RSS feed, but non-political feeds are non-existent

Axios, especially their local news (I tested Charlotte), looks like it would actually be a good source. It has none of the other flaws their competitors have, such as no annoying auto-playing videos, and it doesn't recommend me anything political.

The problem is they don't appear to have anything outside the main RSS feed that is just littered with political trash. I can't even get ones for local stations like I can with NBC and CBS. I recommend if you like them to try a 3rd party RSS source.

I'm giving them a D+ simply because they don't shove politics in your face, but unless the RSS situation improves, I can't in good faith move this up on the list, which honestly, I'd love to do as everything else is actually quite nice.

#### Associated Press
**Rank:** D--

**Link:** https://github.com/rererecursive/associated-press-rss

**Date added:** November 21 2024

**Lasted tested on**: November 22 2024

+ ✅ Updates Regularly
+ ✅ Free
+ ✅ Annoying feature free: Does not have autoplaying videos, videos that follow you, or other annoying features.
+ ❌ Not time tested
+ ❌ Non-Political feeds sometimes mix in Politics
+ ❌ Articles are aggressive with trying to get you to view political content.
+ ☠️ RSS Feeds Very hard to find or requires a 3rd party
+ ☠️ RSS Feed has no options

They used to offer RSS feeds for each section so you could opt-out of political nonsense, but they no longer do this. You can get news from those sections with a third party tool to generate an RSS feed, but I shouldn't even have to use a third party to get a basic feature. The RSS client I use even suggested a third party. The link above lets you filter by category, but I cannot get this to work. RSSHub also works if you really want this source.

I checked two sections of their site (Oddities and Lifestyle). The lifestyle feed felt the need to talk about politics. I tried an article about Coffee and was also recommended me politics in the middle of the article.

Many of the interesting things they do have can be found on other news aggregators. 

I would not recommend the AP to anyone. Simply put, AP News is unprofessional with its RSS feeds, and in my opinion, unprofessional for a company of it's size. If they could fix these problems, I would easily move this up to a B rank. AP is one step away from being on the *Do Not Recommend* list.

I'm keeping them on the list because they're not the worst offenders, at least, not at the time of this writing.

#### PBS
**Rank:** D--

**Link:** https://rss.feedspot.com/pbs_news_hour_rss_feeds/

**Date added:** November 21 2024

**Lasted tested on**: November 21 2024

+ ✅ Free
+ ✅ Annoying feature free
+ ➖ Articles may recommend political content on you, but it's minor
+ ❌ Not time tested
+ ❌ RSS Feeds Hard to find
+ ❌ RSS Feed does not offer many options
+ ❌ Non-Political feeds sometimes mix in Politics
+ ❌ Updates less often

PBS is quite literally on the threshold of being on the do not request list. I tried all their feeds and only **their art feed** did not have politics mixed in. I'm being *very* generous here, mainly because I do want to try and balance the over all list.

You would think with a name like "Public Broadcasting Station" it would try to appeal to the public about things that matter. Instead, they come off sounding like a Facebook comment section, or that annoying guy at work who never shuts up about politics.

Some of the stories I saw there were already on other, better sources listed above.

I'm a reasonable person, maybe they have other RSS feeds I couldn't find. I only found them because feedspot happened to have a list of 10 of them. I will review this at a later date.

## Disclaimer

Everything on this list is my opinion. If you don't like my opinion, that is fine. There are other lists I am sure.

Just because I put a site on this list does not mean I endorse them. My goal is to simply find sources of news that don't have politics, and don't try to get me to read politics. I tried to be fair, but I am not perfect, no one is.

In the end, I make a judgment call based on what I feel is to political. This process is obviously going to be biased. My hope though is, that as time goes on, at least sites ranked in the A-Tier can be sources everyone can enjoy.

## Contributing

If you think you have a source that should be added. Open an issue and make your case. Do not ask about sources on the Do Not Request List.

If a site is on the Do Not Request list, and I either made a mistake, or the stated reason no longer applies, let me know, I'll take a look.

If you think I am wrong, open an issue.

I reserve the right to close your issue without discussion. I do not have enough time in the day to have arguments on the Internet.

If you really think I am wrong, fork the repo. At the top of this repo I even have a link to forks so that people can see alternative opinions.

## FAQ

**Q.** Did a recipe site actually recommend you politics?

**A.** Yes. Twice. It was the catalyst for making this list.

---

**Q.** How dare you suggest people read *a news source I don't like*.

**A.** I am not recommending anyone do anything. I simply checked some RSS feeds, looked to see if they had news that was not political, and made a judgment call. You are free to fork my list and use it as a base for your own. I have even liked the forks list on this page so people can get alternative opinions.

---

**Q.** Your list favors the left/down/up/right/a/b/[ascended](https://i.imgur.com/dKbO1py.jpeg)!

**A.** Then recommend me some RSS feeds that avoid politics from your side.

---

**Q.** No, but seriously your list favors-

**A.** Yes, I know. For some reason some sides are very allergic to the concept of RSS feeds, and the ones that aren't are very bad at keeping politics out of their non-political sections. Yet, I still included them on my list.

By the way, when I did this I used this chart (https://www.allsides.com/media-bias/media-bias-chart) and tried my best to select sources from both sides of it. Some of those sources did not even have a non-political section, and some did, and it almost everything was political.

I also went out of my way to find sources from Canada, and I even added a British and Australian source. Canada had the same problem US sources had. So if you know of a source that meets the criteria, once again, recommend me some RSS feeds.
